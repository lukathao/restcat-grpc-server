# ReadMe

## IMPORTANT
A lot of boilerplate code is autogenerated for you
To generate code visit the Generate Code section
For modifying code visit the modifying code section
Do not mess with anything in these folders:
- ./db/sqlc
- ./db/schema/*
- ./generated/*

## Homebrew formulas
- protobuf
- clang-format *optional for formatting code

## Installations
- go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

## Modifying Code
Modifying gRPC code
- you only need to modify the contract in the proto folder
- ./proto

Modifying sql API
- you only need to modify the sql commands in these folders and sqlc will generate the API code for you to use, PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMMENT as it will determine how the code is generated for you
- ./db/query/*

Modifying Db schema
- Do not directly modify the schemas in the sql files, visit dbdiagram to view the diagrams and modify the schema there, export to postgres and copy over the schema into the schema.up.sql file
- (requries login) https://dbdiagram.io/d/Restaurantsv2-66fecb7afb079c7ebd40f3a2

## Generating code
Generate gRPC code
- make gen_res

Generate sql api code
- make sqlc

## Testing
gRPC
- Postman

## Debugging
local service code:
- debug in VS Code

## Running
Running without docker container:
